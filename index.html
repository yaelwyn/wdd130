        <p>Hey Guys,My name is Yann Elwyn Ehounou, though you are welcome to address me simply as Yann, Elwyn, or
            Ehounou—I respond to all
            three! I proudly trace my origins back to the Ivory Coast (Côte d'Ivoire), a vibrant nation nestled in West
            Africa. My
            current base is in the United States, specifically in Utah, where I relocated to focus on my academic
            pursuits and
            attend my in-person classes at BYU (Brigham Young University). When I am not busy with studies, my life is
            fueled by my
            diverse interests: I am deeply passionate about sports, I immerse myself in the captivating narratives of
            anime and
            manga, I certainly enjoy eating good food, and I value the time spent going out with friends. However, my
            most
            significant passion remains video games. Looking back, a defining accomplishment in my life was successfully
            completing
            a challenging and rather eventful mission I undertook in the Republic of the Congo, located in Central
            Africa. </p>

        <p>Abidjan is the economic capital and largest city of Cote d'Ivoire (Ivory Coast). Although Yamoussoukro is the
            official political capital, Abidjan serves as the primary urban, industrial, and financial center of the
            nation and Francophone West Africa.</p>
