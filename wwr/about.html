            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>1985: The Roots of Adventure
                Founded by geologist Elias Vance under the name Pointe Zénith, our company was born from a simple
                vision: to make true
                exploration accessible, relying on rigor and respect for the great outdoors. The very first expedition,
                a meticulous
                crossing of a remote plateau, established our initial commitment to prudence and efficiency.

                2010: The Anchor Protocol
                After years of refining our logistical techniques, we formalized our core values into the "Anchor
                Protocol." This
                document represents our dedication to Absolute Safety, the Impeccable Quality of our services, and an
                Excellent
                Cost-Benefit Ratio. This protocol became the guarantee of the turnkey experience we offer.

                Today: Exploration Reimagined
                Now known as [Company Name], we perpetuate Vance's pioneering spirit. We transform complex challenges
                into transparent
                and secure adventures, making every journey an unforgettable and unparalleled moment. We are the
                benchmark for those
                seeking to realize their quest for exploration with total peace of mind.</p>
